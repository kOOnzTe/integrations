# Integrations by Junior Payments Products Team

In the Integrations project, our team developed third-party integrations for Shopify and Shopier platforms, along with first-party integration for Jotform Tables. This system works on Jotform Form Builder's Product List, enabling users to import products from their Shopify and Shopier stores (shops) directly into the Jotform Form Builder's Product List. Users can effortlessly select products from these third-party integrations and add them to their Jotform Forms. Additionally, users can select products uploaded to Jotform Tables and add them to their Jotform Forms. The system supports two-way synchronization, allowing users to update product features both from Jotform Forms and Jotform Tables.

To achieve first-party integration, we utilized the Jotform API's necessary endpoints and developed additional endpoints on Jotform's intern-API. The backend was built with PHP using the MVC design pattern and MySQL. For the frontend, we incorporated the required logic and design using React class components, JavaScript, and the Redux library for global state management.

For third-party integration, we followed the API documentation of both Shopify and Shopier. We implemented OAuth2 authorization to manage authentication stages. The frontend development involved creating modals, lists, panels, and other components using React and TypeScript, along with Jotform CSS, a Tailwind-like CSS library. The Context API was used for global state management.
