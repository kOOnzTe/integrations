# Integrations by Junior Payments Products Team

In the Integrations project, our team developed third-party integrations for Shopify and Shopier platforms, along with first-party integration for Jotform Tables. This system works on Jotform Form Builder's Product List, enabling users to import products from their Shopify and Shopier stores (shops) directly into the Jotform Form Builder's Product List. Users can effortlessly select products from these third-party integrations and add them to their Jotform Forms. Additionally, users can select products uploaded to Jotform Tables and add them to their Jotform Forms. The system supports two-way synchronization, allowing users to update product features both from Jotform Forms and Jotform Tables.

To achieve first-party integration, we utilized the necessary endpoints from the Jotform API, complemented by newly created endpoints on the intern-api using PHP and MySQL. The required frontend logic and design were incorporated into React class components using JavaScript.

For third-party integration, we leveraged the API documentation of both Shopify and Shopier. OAuth2 authorization was implemented to manage the authentication stages. The necessary modals, frontend logic, and design were developed using React, TypeScript, and Jotform CSS, a Tailwind-like CSS library.
